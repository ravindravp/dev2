In this article, we are going to design and build a cool and user-friendly single-page application (SPA) using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A single-page application contains multiple pages which can be navigated or visited without loading the page every time. This makes things faster and more interesting.

Final Output
Approach:
Firstly, we will create a folder with the project name and create the HTML(e.g index.html) , CSS (e.g style.css) , JavaScript files, Images folder and a separate file for the responsive CSS if required.
Now, use the different HTML tags like section, header, meta, title, head,div, img etc to structure the web page. and includes a header, navigation bar, main content area, and a script tag for our JavaScript file.
Add some Style using CSS to the HTML code to make our frontend look good. We'll choose colors and layouts that look modern and inviting. Add style mainly to the image and beautify the header. and we will be using a gradient color to give a greenish look to the header.
Add the JavaScript to change content dynamically. let's add some JavaScript magic. The changeContent function will be our main things, updating the content based on what the user clicks.
You can create a navigation system that dynamically loads content based on user interactions.
